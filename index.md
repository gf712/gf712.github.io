<h1 class="page-title">My personal blog</h1>

This is where I write about things that I find interesting! My topics of interest are Bioinformatics, Software Development and Machine Learning!

## Who am I?
I am currently a Bioinformatics PhD student in [Professor Andrew Martin's lab](http://bioinf.org.uk), at UCL. I am also a [Shogun.ML](https://github.com/shogun-toolbox/shogun) core developer, where I mainly optimise code, improve the API and do code reviews. In 2018/2019 I was a part time software developer in the [
Research Engineering](http://rse.turing.ac.uk) team at the [Alan Turing Institute](https://www.turing.ac.uk), where I worked on [enabling reproducible machine learning pipelines with shogun](https://www.turing.ac.uk/research/research-projects/enabling-meta-learning-shogunml).
